# ivyCosmetics
Ivy Cosmetics was requested by a University Student at Fiverr.com, it was impressively made in 6 hours, the most rushed website job of my life.
It was one of the needings of the project to have no HTML erros/bad writing, following the strict pattern from W3 organisation.

As it was developed in a rush, it's only working at the 1366x768 screen size.
